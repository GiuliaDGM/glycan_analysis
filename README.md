# Environment Setup with UV

For this project, we will be using **UV** to create and manage our environments.

### Why UV and not Conda?
1. **Speed** â€“ UV is significantly faster than Conda for package installation and dependency resolution.
2. **Lightweight** â€“ Unlike Conda, UV does not require a separate package manager and works efficiently with `pyproject.toml`.
3. **Better Dependency Management** â€“ UV offers improved dependency resolution and reproducibility compared to Conda.

For more details, visit the **[UV Documentation](https://astral.sh/uv/)**.
